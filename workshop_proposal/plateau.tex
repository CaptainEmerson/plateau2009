\begin{abstract}

Programming languages exist to enable effective development of
software systems. The aim of this workshop is to discuss methods,
metrics and techniques for evaluating languages and language tools
against their intended design design principles. These design
principles range over a large space including making programs easier
to read, write, and learn; providing programs more flexibilty and
power to create a wider array of progams; and restricting programming
to provide safety and security properties. We plan to gather the
intersection of researchers in the object-oriented programming
language and human computer interaction communities who are working on
languages and tools to share their research and discuss the future of
usability and evaluation of programming languages. We are also
interested in the input of other members of the programming language
community working on related areas such as refactoring, design
patterns, program analysis, program comprehension, software
visualization, end-user programming, and aspect-oriented software
development.

\section{Main Themes and Goals}

This workshop aims to develop and stimulate discussion of usability
and evaluation of programming languages and tools with respect to
language design and related areas.  We will consider: empirical
studies of programming languages; methodologies and philosophies
behind language and tool evaluation; software design metrics and their
relations to the underlying language; user studies of language
features and software engineering tools; visual techniques for
understanding programming languages; critical comparisons of
programming paradigms, such as object-oriented vs. functional; and
tools to support evaluating programming languages.  We aim to develop
a community of domain experts to share ideas and collaborate on
research related to the evaluation and usability of object-oriented
languages and tools.

Finally, James is also a director of the Hillside Group and Foundation Editor-In-Chief of Transactions on Pattern Languages of Programming, (07-present).

\item \textbf{Andrew Black} - is a Professor of Computer Science, Portland State University, USA. His research interests are in the area of programming languages, operating systems, object-oriented systems and distributed computing, and more specifically in the region where they overlap (such as language design for distributed Object-oriented computing). Andrew has been on the PC of OOPSLA (08, 05) and Chair of ECOOP (05) and PC member (07, 06, 05, 03).

\item \textbf{Todd Millstein} - is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, USA. His research areas include ... . Todd has been on the PC of OOPSLA (09) and ECOOP (08).

\item \textbf{Ewan Tempero} - is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science, University of Auckland, New Zealand. The main goal of his research is to make programmers more productive, that is, help the people who actually produce code to do so faster, with less effort, fewer errors, and with more enjoyment than currently. His research interests are in the area of object-oriented programming languages, software reuse, tool support for programmers, software visualization, and the software development process.

\item \textbf{Stuart Marshall} - is a Lecturer in the School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. His research interests are in the area of mobile user interfaces, software reuse, and software visualization.

\item \textbf{Bob Fuhrer} - is a Research Staff Member at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in Hawthorne, NY, USA. He currently works in the Program Analysis and Transformation group on advanced refactoring and static analysis. Robert leads the SAFARI project, whose goal is to develop a meta-tooling platform for creating full-featured language-specific IDEs for Eclipse, including editing, navigation, analysis and refactoring. Robert is also a member of the team creating the X10 programming language.

\item \textbf{Donna Malayeri} - is a PhD student in the Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Her PhD topic is Retroactive Abstraction, Extensibility and Inheritance in Object-Oriented Languages and is supervised by Jonathan Aldrich. Donna's research interests include programming languages, including usability, tools, and environments; static analysis;  and human-computer interaction. 

\item \textbf{Greg Morrisett} - is a Professor of Computer Science, Harvard University, USA. Greg's research has focused on the programming language design and implementation as well as software security.  He is best known for his work on developing type systems that guarantee strong safety and security properties for low-level languages, including typed intermediate compiler languages, typed assembly language, and Cyclone, a type-safe dialect of C.

\item \textbf{Jeff Foster} is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department and UMIACS at the University of Maryland, College Park. The goal of his research is to develop practical tools and techniques to improve software quality. His research interests are programming languages, software engineering, advanced static type systems, scalable constraint-based analysis, and building tools that implement his ideas.

\section{Anticipated Attendance}

We anticipate the following number of attendees:

\begin{itemize}
\item Minimum: 10 
\item Ideal: 25 
\item Maximum: 40 
\end{itemize}

\section{Advertisement}

There was a workshop focused on the Interplay between Usability Evaluation and Software Development (I-USED) in 2008, and a F/OSS Usability Workshop in 2006.

We will advertise this workshop by inviting participants of past workshops directly, as well as by emailing related mailing lists and specific people known to be working in this area. In addition we will maintain a website for presenting position papers and organizational information. 

\section{Participant Preparation}

Workshop participants should submit a position paper prior to one month before the 
workshop. Position papers will be made available through the workshop website and 
participants are encouraged to have read the position papers before attending the 
workshop. Participants are also asked to prepare a presentation to support their position paper. 
We will accept long papers (max. 8 pages) that describes new work based on the themes and goals of the workshop or related topics, or short papers (max. 4 pages) that can describe work-in-progress, report on experiences gained, question accepted wisdom, raise challenging open problems, or propose speculative new approaches.

\section{Activities and Format}

This workshop will be run as a full-day workshop at OOPSLA 2009. We will have an introduction and keynote session in the morning followed by the presentation of workshop papers. The last session of the day will include some workshop papers followed by a panel on the ``Gap Between Programming Languages and Human Computer Interaction". If we have time we will prepare a poster for the Welcome Reception. Table \ref{tab:schedule} outlines the schedule of the format of the workshop.
