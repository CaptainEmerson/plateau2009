\begin{abstract}

  Programming languages exist to enable programmers to develop
  software effectively.  But how \emph{efficiently} programmers can
  write software depends on the usability of the languages and tools
  that they develop with.  The aim of this workshop is to discuss
  methods, metrics and techniques for evaluating the usability of
  languages and language tools.  The supposed benefits of such
  languages and tools cover a large space, including making programs
  easier to read, write, and maintain; allowing programmers to write
  more flexible and powerful programs; and restricting programs to
  make them more safe and secure. We plan to gather the intersection
  of researchers in the programming language, programming tool, and
  human-computer interaction communities to share their research and
  discuss the future of evaluation and usability of programming
  languages and tools. We are also interested in the input of other
  members of the programming research community working on related
  areas, such as refactoring, design patterns, program analysis,
  program comprehension, software visualization, end-user programming,
  and other programming language paradigms.

\section{Main Themes and Goals}

At the Programming Languages Grand Challenges panel at POPL 2009, Greg
Morrisett claimed that one of the great neglected areas in programming
languages research is the bridge between programming languages and
human-computer interaction: the evaluation of the usability of
programming languages and tools. This is evident by the recent
research programs of major languages conferences such as POPL, PLDI,
OOPSLA, and ECOOP. The object-oriented conferences tend to have at
least one or two papers in the areas of corpus analysis or evaluation
methodologies, but the authors of the papers seem to avoid using the
results of their studies to make conclusions about the languages or
tools themselves. Software engineering and human-computer interaction
conferences tend to have better support of language usability analysis
(CHI 2009 had three tracks that showcase research in this direction),
but have limited visibility to the programming languages community.

Following on to our previous workshop of the same name at OOPSLA 
2009\footnote{http://ecs.victoria.ac.nz/Events/PLATEAU/},
this workshop aims to begin filling that void by
developing and stimulating discussion of usability and evaluation of
programming languages and tools with respect to language design and
related areas. We will consider: empirical studies of programming
languages; methodologies and philosophies behind language and tool
evaluation; software design metrics and their relations to the
underlying language; user studies of language features and software
engineering tools; visual techniques for understanding programming
languages; critical comparisons of programming paradigms, such as
object-oriented vs. functional; and tools to support evaluating
programming languages. We have two goals:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
Develop a research community that shares ideas and collaborates on 
research related to the evaluation and usability of languages and tools.
\item
Encourage the languages and tools communities to think more critically
about how usability affects the  design and
adoption of languages and tools.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Organizers}

The logistical organisation of this workshop will be done by the following organizers.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Emerson Murphy-Hill} is currently a

\end{itemize}

\section{Program Committee}

Along with the organizers, the following people will form the Program
Committee (PC) for the workshop and will help promote the workshop in
the programming languages and human-computer interaction communities.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Andrew P. Black} is a Professor of Computer Science,
  Portland State University, USA. His research interests are in the
  area of programming languages, operating systems, object-oriented
  systems and distributed computing, and more specifically in the
  region where they overlap (such as language design for distributed
  object-oriented computing). Andrew has been on the PC of OOPSLA
  ('08, '05) and Chair of ECOOP ('05) and PC member ('07, '06, '05,
  '03).

\item 
\textbf{Rob DeLine} is a member of the Human Interactions in Programming
group at Microsoft Research in Seattle, WA. His recent research has included
recommender systems for team newcomers, the use of spatial memory to navigate 
large code bases, and knowledge retainment in long-lived projects. He is the
co-creator, along with Randy Pausch, of the Alice rapid prototyping system.
Prior to joining Microsoft Research, he received a Ph.D. in Computer Science
from Carnegie Mellon University and an M.S. in Computer Science
from the University of Virgina.

\item
\textbf{Christine A. Halverson} is\ldots

\item
\textbf{Donna Malayeri} is a postdoctoral researcher in the Scala group at 
Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. She received her 
Ph.D. in 2009 from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. Her thesis explored 
the role of type systems in developing extensible software. She served on the 
program committee for PLATEAU 2008 and has been an  external reviewer for a 
number of international top-tier conferences and journals.

\item \textbf{Rob Miller} is an associate professor in the MIT EECS department 
and a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He
