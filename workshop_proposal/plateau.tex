\maketitle
\begin{abstract}

  Programming languages exist to enable programmers to develop
  software effectively.  But how \emph{efficiently} programmers can
  write software depends on the usability of the languages and tools
  that they develop with.  The aim of this workshop is to discuss
  methods, metrics and techniques for evaluating the usability of
  languages and language tools.  The supposed benefits of such
  languages and tools cover a large space, including making programs
  easier to read, write, and maintain; allowing programmers to write
  more flexible and powerful programs; and restricting programs to
  make them more safe and secure. We plan to gather the intersection
  of researchers in the programming language, programming tool, and
  human-computer interaction communities to share their research and
  discuss the future of evaluation and usability of programming
  languages and tools. We are also interested in the input of other
  members of the programming research community working on related
  areas, such as refactoring, design patterns, program analysis,
  program comprehension, software visualization, end-user programming,
  and other programming language paradigms.

\section{Main Themes and Goals}

Following on from the three previous workshops at OOPSLA/Onward! 
and SPLASH, this workshop aims to bring together practitioners and
researchers interested discussing usability and evaluation of
programming languages and tools with respect to language design and
related areas. We will consider: empirical studies of programming
languages; methodologies and philosophies behind language and tool
evaluation; software design metrics and their relations to the
underlying language; user studies of language features and software
engineering tools; visual techniques for understanding programming
languages; critical comparisons of programming paradigms, such as
object-oriented vs. functional; and tools to support evaluating
programming languages. We have two goals:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
Develop and sustain a research community that shares ideas and collaborates on 
research related to the evaluation and usability of languages and tools.
\item
Encourage the languages and tools communities to think more critically
about how usability affects the  design and adoption of languages and tools.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Organizers}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Shane Markstrum} is currently a Software Engineer at Google in New York, USA. Prior to joining Google he was an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science
  department at Bucknell University and a Visiting Scholar at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. He received his Ph.D. from the University of
  California, Los Angeles in 2009. His research interests include
  domain-specific languages and tools for extensible type systems; and 
  building tool support for non-traditional language constructs.
  
\item \textbf{Emerson Murphy-Hill} is currently an Assistant Professor at North Carolina State University, USA. Prior to joining the NCSU faculy he was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia in the Software Practices Lab with Gail Murphy. 
  He recieved is Ph.D. from Portland State University in 2009.
  His research interests include human-computer interaction and software tools. 

\item \textbf{Caitlin Sadowski} is currently a PhD student in the 
  Computer Science Department at UC Santa Cruz where she is advised by Jim Whitehead and Cormac Flanagan. Her PhD topic is \emph{Usability and Parallel Programming}. Her research interests include the evaluation and usability of programming languages and software, parallelism and concurrency, and computer science education. She was a recipient of a distinguish paper award at OOPSLA 2011 for her paper "Two for the Price of One: A Model for Parallel and Incremental Computation."
\end{itemize}

\item Jonathan Edwards - MIT, USA
\item Thomas Fritz - University of Zurich, Switzerland
\item Philip Guo - Google, USA
\item Mike Hicks - University of Maryland, USA
\item Thomas LaToza - UC Irvine, USA
\item Donna Malayeri - Microsoft, USA
\item Greg Morrisett - Harvard University, USA
\item Portia O'Callaghan - MathWorks, USA

\end{itemize}


\section{Anticipated Attendance}

We anticipate the following number of attendees:

\begin{itemize}
\item Minimum: 20 
\item Ideal: 35
\item Maximum: 60 
\end{itemize}

\section{Advertisement}

We will advertise this workshop by inviting participants of workshops
in the areas of language design, tools, and general usability
directly; as well as by emailing related mailing lists, posting on
blogs contacting specific people known to be working in this area directly,
and through a mailing list our group mailing list. In addition we will maintain a website\footnote{http://ecs.victoria.ac.nz/Events/PLATEAU/} for presenting position papers and organizational information.

\section{Participant Preparation}\label{preparation}

Workshop participants should submit a paper prior to one
month before the workshop. Papers will be made available
through the workshop website and participants are encouraged to have
read the papers before attending the workshop. Participants
are also asked to prepare a short presentation to support their
paper. We will accept papers up to 10 pages in length.
To help improve the quality of submissions, 
we will provide attendees with exemplary papers and presentations
from previous conferences.

\vfill\eject

We will look for papers that describe work-in-progress or recently completed work based on the themes and goals of the workshop or related topics, report on experiences gained, question accepted wisdom, raise challenging open problems, or propose
speculative new approaches. We plan to have the workshop proceedings published in the ACM Digital Library.

\section{Activities and Format}

This workshop will be run as a full-day workshop at SPLASH and Onward! 2012.  We
will have an introduction and keynote session in the morning followed
by the presentation of workshop papers in three separate sessions followed by a breakout session at the end. We will prepare a poster for the SPLASH/Onward! Welcome Reception representing the presentations of the papers. Table~\ref{tab:schedule} outlines the schedule of the format of the workshop.

\section{Post-workshop Activities}

We will publish our participant's papers in the ACM Digital Library, as outlined earlier (\S \ref{preparation}). We aim to continue hosting this workshop in future years.

\section{Special Requirements}

We require the room to have easels, pens, and paper for our breakout sessions; 
Internet access; power strips for attendees to plug their laptops into; and a computer projector and
screen for attendees to show the presentations of their position
papers.
